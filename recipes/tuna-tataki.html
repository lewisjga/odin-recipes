        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple, tuna-focused entree, this dish is little more than dressed up seared tuna. However, the tuna and its accompanying sauce and toppings make for a dish far better than its simplicity would let on. Make sure to get the freshest tuna you can to improve the experience even more.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb Tuna Steak</li>
            <li>3 oz Edamame</li>

            <li>1 1/2 tsp Sugar</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brush tuna with 2 tsp of your sesame oil and season well</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan on medium-high heat, and cook the tuna for 30 seconds on each side, searing but leaving the inside rare</li>
            <li>Rinse tuna in cold water, then pat dry and slice thinly</li>
            <li>Blanch the edamame in lightly salted boiling water for one minute, drain, rinse in cold water, and pat dry</li>
            <li>Set aside tuna and edamame, then combine all remaining ingredients in a bowl to create the sauce</li>
            <li>Plate the tuna, and garnish with edamame, drizzle sauce on top and serve</li>
